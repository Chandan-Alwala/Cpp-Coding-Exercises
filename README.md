# Cpp-Coding-Exercises

## This Repo consists of problems and solutions to some of the tricky problems. Solutions are with C++

#Problem1:
Write a program that can perform encryption and decryption using an arbitrary substitution cipher. In this case, the encryption array is a random shuffling of the letters in the alphabet. Your program should generate a random encryption array, its corresponding decryption array, and use these to encode and decode a message.

#Problem2: 
Suppose you are given two circularly linked lists, L and M, that is, two lists of nodes such that each node has a non-null next node. Write a program for telling if L and M are really the same list of nodes but with different (cursor) starting points.

#Problem3: 
Write a program that can solve instances of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

#Problem4: 
Write a simple text editor, which stores a string of characters using the list ADT, together with a cursor object that highlights the position of some character in the string (or possibly the position before the first character). Your editor should support the following operations and redisplay the current text (that is, the list) after performing any one of them.
Left: Move cursor left one character (or nothing if at the beginning); Right: Move cursor right one character (or do nothing if at the end)
Delete: Delete the character to the right of the cursor (or do nothing if at the end); Insert c: Insert the character c just after the cursor

#Problem5: 
Write a program that can play Tic-Tac-Toe effectively.

#Problem6:
Write a program that takes, as input, a fully parenthesized, arithmetic expression and converts it to a binary expression tree. Your program should display the tree in some way and also print the value associated with the root. For an additional challenge, allow for the leaves to store variables of the form x1, x2, x3, and so on, which are initially 0 and which can be updated interactively by your program, with the corresponding update in the printed value of the root of the expression tree.
